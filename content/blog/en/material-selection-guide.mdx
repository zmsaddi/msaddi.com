# Material Selection Guide for Metal Fabrication Projects

Selecting the right material for your metal fabrication project is one of the most critical decisions you'll make. The material affects not only the performance and durability of your final product but also manufacturing costs, lead times, and overall project success.

## Material Selection Criteria

### Mechanical Properties

Consider the forces and stresses your part will experience:

**Tensile Strength**
- Maximum stress before breaking
- Critical for load-bearing parts
- Varies significantly between materials

**Yield Strength**
- Stress at which permanent deformation begins
- Important for structural applications
- Determines safe working load

**Hardness**
- Resistance to deformation and wear
- Important for contact surfaces
- Can be enhanced through heat treatment

**Ductility**
- Ability to deform without breaking
- Critical for forming operations
- Higher ductility = better formability

**Toughness**
- Resistance to impact and shock
- Important for dynamic loads
- Combination of strength and ductility

### Environmental Factors

**Corrosion Exposure**
- Marine environments: 316 stainless or aluminum
- Indoor dry: Carbon steel acceptable
- Chemical exposure: Specific stainless grades
- Outdoor weather: Stainless or coated steel

**Temperature Range**
- High temperature: Stainless steel alloys
- Cryogenic: 304/316 stainless, aluminum
- Thermal cycling: Materials with stable properties
- Heat dissipation: Aluminum or copper

**Contact with Other Materials**
- Galvanic corrosion risk
- Material compatibility
- Fastener selection
- Isolation requirements

### Fabrication Considerations

**Cutting Requirements**
- Laser cutting: Most metals up to thickness limits
